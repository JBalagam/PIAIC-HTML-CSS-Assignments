            <strong>Why it's special:</strong> Robby incorporates an interactive experience into his portfolio.<br /><br />
            <strong>What it's about:</strong> If you associate portfolios with a dry list of facts, this portfolio might surprise you. Robby found a novel way of displayin what otherwise was dry information - he laid out his portfolio site as a video
            game that the visitor can acutally play. This incredibly fun interactive design portfolio will make you scroll.
